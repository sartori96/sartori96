## About Me
I am currently a backend developer living in Japan.

It has always been my dream to live and work in Japan as a developer. To pursue this dream, I graduated in Information Systems from InstituiÃ§Ã£o Toledo de Ensino, where I began my journey as a developer under the guidance of excellent professionals in the field of information technology. As the next step, I moved to Japan at the beginning of 2022 to learn Japanese. After completing my studies at a Japanese language school, I passed the JLPT N2 (Japanese Language Proficiency Test) before graduation and am currently preparing for the N1 level. My aim is to achieve N1 proficiency by December 2024.

Currently, I am enrolled at a Japanese IT technical school to enhance my technical and communication skills. As part of the curriculum, I am studying the Office package, programming, and both oral and written Japanese.

Before coming to Japan, I worked as a developer for nearly 3 years in Brazil, primarily using the C++ language along with SQL Server. Additionally, I have worked on personal projects to improve my skills using C#, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, and Flask. I also have experience in game development using Unity, Unreal, and Godot engines.
