## About Me
Backend Developer. Currently residing in Japan. 

 It has always been my dream to live and work in Japan as a developer. I came to Japan at the beginning of 2022 to learn Japanese, as the second step of my journey.
 The first step was to graduate in Information Systems at InstituiÃ§Ã£o Toledo de Ensino, where I had the opportunity to start my journey as a developer being guided by excellent professionals in the area of information technology.
 At the moment I'm studying the Japanese language at Mirai Gakuen in Maebashi city. I have passed level N4 of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), and I'm studying for level N3. My goal is to reach the level N2 until Dezember of 2023.

 I worked as a developer using mainly the C++ language along with SQL Server. I also developed personal projects to improve my skills using C#, Python, MongoDB, MySQL, Flask, as well as in the game development area, using Unity, Unreal and Godot Engines.
